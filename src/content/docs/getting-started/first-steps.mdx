import Callout from '@/components/mdx/Callout.astro';

# First Steps

Now that you have the project installed, let's walk through creating your first page.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── content/        # Blog posts and documentation
├── layouts/        # Page layouts
├── pages/          # Route definitions
└── styles/         # Global styles and themes
```

## Creating Your First Post

### 1. Choose a Topic

Navigate to `src/content/blog/` and either use an existing topic folder or create a new one.

### 2. Create the Topic Metadata

If creating a new topic, add a `_topic.yaml` file:

```yaml
slug: my-topic
title: My Topic
description: Description of what this topic covers.
banner: /images/topics/my-topic.jpg
```

### 3. Write Your Post

Create an MDX file in your topic folder:

```mdx
---
title: "My First Post"
description: "A brief description of my post."
date: 2024-01-15
---

# My First Post

Your content goes here. You can use Markdown and custom components.
```

<Callout type="tip">
Use the frontmatter `draft: true` to hide posts while you're still working on them.
</Callout>

## Using Components

MDX allows you to import and use components:

```mdx
import Callout from '@/components/mdx/Callout.astro';

<Callout type="note">
This is a note callout.
</Callout>
```

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The `preview` command lets you test the production build locally.
