# Installation Guide

Get started with the project in minutes by following these installation steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or pnpm
- Git

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
cd project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

<Callout type="warning">
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive credentials.
</Callout>

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Docker Setup

For a containerized setup:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts all required services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Meilisearch).

<Callout type="tip">
Use Docker for development to ensure consistent environments across your team.
</Callout>

## Verification

Verify your installation by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

If the build completes without errors, you're all set!
